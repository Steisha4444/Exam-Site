                                     On his first task as a god, he meets a mysterious demon who rules the ghosts and
                                      terrifies the Heavens……yet unbeknownst to Xie Lian, this

                                    who died 13 years prior to the start of the story. He was a controversial figure in his time as
                                     he used the ‘dark arts’ to utilize his magic. He becomes known as the founder of the Demonic

                                     Xuanyu has summoned him to do.
                                   
                                   Wei Wuxian gets a surprise second chance at life, but he’s haunted by the reputation he left behind prior to his death. He quickly finds himself interacting with people he knew before he died, some of whom suspect his true identity and some who don’t. He embarks on adventures fighting monsters and solving mysteries across the countryside, dealing with the fallout 
                                   from his previous life along the way.</p></div>

                             etc. Therefore, many aesthetic standards were made according to the environments 
                             (socially, geographically, economically, politically) of certain dynastic. 
                            This is the main reason why traditional Chinese clothing has such many styles.

                                            be beneficial to him to get another role in a BL adaptation, specially the shou character.

                                            would be too confusing, he was already another of mxtx's mc's.
